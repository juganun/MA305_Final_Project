MA305 Final Project


This is our Covid anaylsis project. All the files and contained in this folder.

To run properly, unzip folder and drag to directory that is opened by the program you use.

The unzipped folder contains all the maps for the country, as well as the function for generating the heat map.

The heat map.py file is Heat_map_gen and must be in the same folder as the folder you are running the code from 
in order to generate properly.

Keep Final_Project in the same folder as every other file when you run it and it will function.

Thank you for the class!
